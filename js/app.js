// VERBAL QUESTIONS
// 1) Difference between parameter and argument
// 2) The difference within a function between return and console.log is that 
//      console.log will just print something to the console, whereas return
//      will spit out the result of the function. You can return this result
//      into a variable for use later in the code.
// 3) The fact that functions can return values makes it much easier to write DRY
//      code. Any time you want to get the function's value, you can just call
//      that function, instead of rewriting it every time.
